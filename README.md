# GameCollector
An open source Android application for managing a hobbyists collection.

**Purpose**
GameCollector's goal is to become an applcation which helps hobbyists track and manage their private collections.
Whether you're collecting video games, wines, books, musical instruments, etc. the current popular methods for tracking 
your collectables does not offer robust features which are unique to the item you're collecting. GameCollector and its successor(s)
should be robust applications developed hobbyists, for their hobby.

**Usefullness**
This application's direct use will be to help video game collectors track their collection, but will ultimately act as a resource 
for building more applications that help with monitoring other collections.

**Getting started**
Feel free to make any suggestions, anytime! Also, if you want to convert GameColletor's codebase to monittor a different collectable,
do that anytime.

**Need help?**
Please shoot over all questions, comments, criticisms, and complaints to me. Will do my best to answer quickly.

**My current primary objectives**
1. Add games from all other consoles predating the newest.
2. Display current selling prices for each item (helps users track their collection's value).
3. Clean current lists of video games.
4. Expand breadth of collectibles to include accessories, and additional consoles.
